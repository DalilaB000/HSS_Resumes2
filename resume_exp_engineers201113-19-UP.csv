Developed	and	supported	the	firm’s	global	risk	data	library	(RiskFabric)	which	is	used	on	multiple
risk	platforms,	Excel	and	VBA	plugins	by	risk	managers	for	query	and	calculation	purposes,	by
utilizing	technologies	including	Java	8,	C#,	Spring	Framework,	Oracle	Database,	.NET	Component
Object	Model,	Unit	Testing,	RESTful	API	and	VBA.	The	library	largely	increases	the	efficiency	for
the	work	of	Risk	Management	team,	the	Risk	Managers	are	able	to	read,	write,	calculate	and
aggregate	multi-dimensional	data	and	customize	the	result	format	by	using	the	library,	which
saves	time,	work	load	and	human	efforts,	makes	it	much	easier	for	risk	managers	to	perform	data
calculation,	manipulation	and	sign-off.
Designed	and	Implemented	the	back	end	of	Server	Date	Management	Tool	for	Risk	Engine	which
allows	risk	managers	dynamically	allocate	data	to	different	servers	in	an	ad	hoc	fashion,	along
with	functionalities	that	control	application	states	with	CronTrigger	library	to	schedule	the	job,	using
Java	8,	Microsoft	SQL	Server,	Spring	Framework	and	multithreading	technique.	The	project	is	built
from	scratch,	it	allows	system	to	distribute	servers	properly	in	the	cluster	and	function	as	a	server
load	balancer	when	there	are	limited	number	of	servers	available,	which	significantly	increases
productivity,	reduces	human	efforts	and	avoid	server	assignment	conflicts.

In my spare time I enjoy programming puzzles and optimising for performance - something I don’t get
to do much of in my current work. Recently I have written a very fast Boggle solver in Python and
Swift (in order to learn the language).
I like to give back to the Open Source community which has helped me so much in my career so far.

Remote part-time/full-time position. ScienceWise's main functions initially were to store scientific
articles and some logical entities, extracted out of them using language processing. System
allowed to store scientific papers organized by topic of discussion and terms and literals present
in it. Current solution required deep changes in order to make it scalable and flexible. Single
application architecture was planned to be changed into common back-end API with multiple
front-end applications built on top of it. My activities on this milestone included: - Technical
discussions regarding architecture re-work - Formalizing requirements and writing them down
as design documentation - Design of REST API specification - Setting tasks for development -
Django development and PostgreSQL massive queries development for views that contained
pre-calculated data Technologies used: - Vagrant - Virtualenv/pip - Django - PostgreSQL Next
step was to build an application, responsible for extraction of debates data. This app needed to
run analysis over tweets and web-pages to figure out what is being spoken on particular topics of
interest, and what kind of opinion is it (positive/negative). This application used back-end API to
store main data (concepts, topics, documents) but processing pipeline was completely changed
to make use of Apache Kafka messaging/log system. With tweets and blog posts processing, the
project shitfed into area of 'Big Data' where volume of data to be processed is dramatically high.

Sole developer working on SOS (Scalable Orders Services) to provide REST-API for searching Orders and Shipments. SOS has
two components: Feeder and Engine. Feeder will consume messages from 3 topics of Kafka and update data in SOLR and
Cassandra. Working on Spring Boot and Apache Camel to route messages received from different topics in feeder. Engine consists
of 5 REST APIs: Order search, Order List, Order details, Order status and Shipment search. For all these 5 API’s, engine will read
data from SOLR and Cassandra. The response time of the API’s is less than 500ms and average request for each API is 20000/Hr.
Using Jenkins to deploy the Docker images on Openshift pods running on Google cloud.
Built from scratch, Initial Data Load (IDL) application which is a Spring Boot batch process. IDL loads data from CSV to SOLR
and Cassandra. First, IDL will split each CSV into 10 partitions and then 10 threads would write data to Cassandra. Once data is
loaded from 5 CSV’s in Cassandra, IDL will read from Cassandra and insert data in SOLR (Orders core and Shipment core).
Deployed IDL on Google Cloud VM and used an in memory H2DB to track the progress of IDL.
Built from scratch, Daily Sync Job (DSJ) which is a Spring Boot batch process. DSJ reads data from Order Management System
database (Oracle) and updates data in Cassandra. DSJ is a single step job, which would execute a PL/SQL query to retrieve data
from OMS database for orders of past two days which are in status (Expired pick up, Invoiced, Ready for Customer Pick Up) and
update the orders in Cassandra so that Kohl’s website is synchronized with OMS records. Used an in memory H2DB to track
progress of DSJ. Used Airflow to schedule the job to run at midnight, configured service now incident to be generated if the job
fails. Using Jenkins to deploy the Docker images on Openshift pods running on Google cloud.",,Senior Software Engineer,WI,109957999.pdf

Graduate Research Assistant:
 My work can be broadly described as the amalgamation of Statistical Learning techniques and Signal
Processing theory.
 Applied these methods in snippets of physiological data to develop statistical models.
 Developed a Generative model that would be able to detect and reconstruct skin conductance
changes from severely under-sampled Electrodermal activity.
 It was a Likelihood and prior based model. The Likelihood was developed based on the functional
form of skin conductance changes and the priors were based on the a priori knowledge of the
parameters used in the functional form. This resulted in a posterior which was maximized to
estimate the parameters for further detection/reconstruction of the skin conductance changes.",,Graduate Research Assistant,University of Toledo,120468156.pdf

way organizations test their recovery strategies.
We sell a web-based management system for testing business continuity plans,
ensuring preparedness of employees and answering the question for organizations
“Will our recovery plans work during a real business disruption?”. Our system,
called Themis, replaces email communication and excel-spreadsheet that are
currently used to manage business continuity testing. It automatically
distributes, collects and compiles testing data across an organization and
tracks if requirements, set by compliance, are met. Engagement of test
participants is also improved through its mobile and tablet integration, which
allows them to access and input exercise information anytime, anywhere. Unlike
competitors, Themis is an application built solely for the purpose of improving
preparedness in organizations through exercising.
Cobar Systems's solutions are built with modern web technologies; allowing for
our product to load efficiently, remain responsive under high load conditions,
be cross-platform and browser compatible, feature real-time communication, and
be highly extensible/maintainable by developers.

Integration of OSS Performance and Fault Man-
agement software for world’s biggest operators of
wireless and wired networks, such as 2.5G, 3G,
LTE, IPTV, PSTN etc. The software is used to mon-
itor the quality of network services and network el-
ements by constantly calculating vital metrics (key
performance indicators, KPI) and aggregating them
into higher level data mining metrics (key qual-
ity indicators, KQI) for SLA. Software is constantly
used in conjunction with Inventory OSS (or other
sources of inventory information) to keep track of
network elements being monitored.
The integra-
tion part consists of development of integration mod-
ules, which allow to gather required data from dif-
ferent sources and use that data to calculate KPIs.
Additionally, inventory adapters can be built to
update inventory information.
The ﬁnal type is
Fault adapters, which can be used to monitor net-
work faults. All the three types can work close to
each other exchanging information. The project is
a project of a full cycle - meaning that for each cus-
tomer involved a full range of services is provided
by the team:
requirements testing, cope imple-
mentation, testing, deployment, support and doc-
umentation.
Key Responsibilities:

(Python, XSLT)
- Direct work with customers on deﬁning the re-
quirements and design of the solution
- Produce the adapters within the strict and tough
timelines
- Unit tests (Python)

Project Descrip-
tion:
Distributed automated platform for navigating merchant sites and perform
wide range of tasks (validating coupon codes with machine learning, collecting
product information, crawling offers, gathering location information, checking
gift cards balance). Genie learns about a merchant through natural & machine
learning. Every retailer chosen is analyzed based on their checkout flow
process. Genie is trained to learn certain common things, such as the price
changes, new website layouts. Each retailer has its own specifications. Genie
starts then determining what specific messages for that particular checkout
mean through machine learning. Platform dynamically scales number of AWS
Spot/On-Demand instances that are used for processing. My improvements to
the project have resulted over $100k in savings each year and doubled number
of merchants that team can support.

It has system that constantly updates its data store with updates from other
systems and stores them in format that is optimized for reading from historical
prospective, also it exposes API that allows other systems to make queries to
retrieve different information for a URL(s) at the given time, enabling training

Contributor, open-source software.
I became a fan of open-source software the moment I consciously used it for the frst time back in
2009, developing a small project in Qt. At that time, I had already been using Linux for over two
years, but most of my projects were written from scratch, meaning that I didn’t use any thirdparty
libraries.
It was September 29, 2009, when the frst project I published to the open-source was born. Since
then I have open-sourced over 30 projects and contributed to over 100, including Linux kernel,
Android for x86, Docker, and Django.
I am an active maintainer of some packages on Docker Hub and conda-forge (Anaconda Python
repository).

Implemented automation scripts for customer-facing and internal applications of UpToDate, an
evidence-based medical clinical decision support resource at the point of care. Initial development efforts
were done in a Java-Selenium framework. For each test scenario I went through a Java design phase where
logically separated the business entity objects from the actual testing code and was able to implement the test
in an Object Oriented fashion. In the code interacted with a SQL object repository database where all element
values were stored. For Angular pages we used Protractor to better handle the automation efforts. Interacted
with an off-shore development team to implement their specific flavor of Protractor.
Participated in daily scrum meetings as part of Agile development methodology. Automation development
efforts were part of 2 week sprints after which test executions were migrated to nightly Jenkins runs in a
JSON file. After each development sprint participated in Technology-wide meetings where presented my
development efforts to a wider audience. Tools used as part of development efforts were Git/Bitbucket for
source-code management, Rally for User Story management and confluence for content collaboration.

Worked on Automation efforts for many Line of Business (LOB) products of Duck Creek Insurance products
such as Home Owner, Commercial Auto, Workers Comp, Dwelling Fire and Personal Auto. Participated in
2 week sprints as part of local and off-shore QA team efforts. Implemented scripts using Java-Selenium,
Javascript and AngularJS using Page Object Model which enforced different regulations for each LOB.
Scope of the scripts consisted of validating XPath value for many different UI controls, populating them and
validating the data in subsequent pages or when editing individual LOBs. Interacted with GIT repository to
manage source code tree changes. Participated in daily meetings as part of Agile development methodology
to plan out the testing practices and efforts.

Was responsible for writing automation for the GUI layer of the application. Initially used Java/Selenium
model and later a Java/Groovy framework. The maturity of frame work allowed us to randomize the
data-input part of the automation and increased the coverage beyond manual testing capabilities. All
automation was scheduled and ran through Jenkins tool. This allowed us to find bugs in the application much
faster than QA. All the tests were run in a selenium grid that supported multiple browsers and a reporting and
logging mechanism. One of daily tasks was to monitor these logs and in case of error find out if it was an
environment issue or there was a bug in the application. In addition automated most of Release Engineering
tasks through Jenkins. This included writing Ruby scripts to interact with Perforce server that managed daily
integration of concurrent release branches, updates from production patches and other activities. Also daily
building and deployment of the application to different stacks were automated through Jenkins which needed
to be monitored daily. Wrote programs that extended java syntax-checking (check-style) capabilities that
tailored it for our own code base. These programs were run daily as part of the build process and reported
duplicate import statements and other warnings/errors. Another Release Engineering task was to run daily
Shell scripts with embedded SQL queries that updated databases with all the table-columns and other related
information as releases progressed. Eventually was automated through Jenkins and monitored daily for errors
that were reported to individual developers who had authored the script. Familiarity with Java/Jsp code
allowed me to fix build compilation errors temporarily so the application would build, prior to having the
developers fix the code.",,48/2016 Automation & Release Engineer,,36405439.pdf

invalid delivered service result. Responsibilities included design verification using UML, testing object
interaction and relationship implemented by associations and aggregation, writing java code to test the data
and interacting with oracle database to insure the integrity of the saved data. Other responsibilities include
