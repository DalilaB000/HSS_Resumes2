Project management
My role as a scrum master has incorporated managing a team and projects from
conception, to planning, to execution, to testing, to release. I have demonstrated an ability
to have projects appropriately scoped and scheduled.
Communication
My legal training and finance training combined with my experience in software has given
me an ability to communicate with people involved in business operations and
requirements, as well as software developers. My scrum master role involves regular
presentations to the rest of the company. I am ideally placed for understanding business
requirements from a software perspective.
