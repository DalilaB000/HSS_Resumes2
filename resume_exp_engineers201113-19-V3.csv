We sell a web-based management system for testing business continuity plans,
ensuring preparedness of employees and answering the question for organizations
“Will our recovery plans work during a real business disruption?”. Our system,
called Themis, replaces email communication and excel-spreadsheet that are
currently used to manage business continuity testing. It automatically
distributes, collects and compiles testing data across an organization and
tracks if requirements, set by compliance, are met. Engagement of test
participants is also improved through its mobile and tablet integration, which
allows them to access and input exercise information anytime, anywhere. Unlike
competitors, Themis is an application built solely for the purpose of improving
preparedness in organizations through exercising.
Cobar Systems's solutions are built with modern web technologies; allowing for
our product to load efficiently, remain responsive under high load conditions,
be cross-platform and browser compatible, feature real-time communication, and
be highly extensible/maintainable by developers.

Integration of OSS Performance and Fault Man-
agement software for world’s biggest operators of
wireless and wired networks, such as 2.5G, 3G,
LTE, IPTV, PSTN etc. The software is used to mon-
itor the quality of network services and network el-
ements by constantly calculating vital metrics (key
performance indicators, KPI) and aggregating them
into higher level data mining metrics (key qual-
ity indicators, KQI) for SLA. Software is constantly
used in conjunction with Inventory OSS (or other
sources of inventory information) to keep track of
network elements being monitored.
The integra-
tion part consists of development of integration mod-
ules, which allow to gather required data from dif-
ferent sources and use that data to calculate KPIs.
Additionally, inventory adapters can be built to
update inventory information.
The ﬁnal type is
Fault adapters, which can be used to monitor net-
work faults. All the three types can work close to
each other exchanging information. The project is
a project of a full cycle - meaning that for each cus-
tomer involved a full range of services is provided
by the team:
requirements testing, cope imple-
mentation, testing, deployment, support and doc-
umentation.
Key Responsibilities:
- Fully responsible for development of 6 adapters
(Python, XSLT)
- Direct work with customers on deﬁning the re-
quirements and design of the solution
- Produce the adapters within the strict and tough
timelines
- Unit tests (Python)

Project Descrip-

Distributed automated platform for navigating merchant sites and perform
wide range of tasks (validating coupon codes with machine learning, collecting
product information, crawling offers, gathering location information, checking
gift cards balance). Genie learns about a merchant through natural & machine
learning. Every retailer chosen is analyzed based on their checkout flow
process. Genie is trained to learn certain common things, such as the price
changes, new website layouts. Each retailer has its own specifications. Genie
starts then determining what specific messages for that particular checkout
mean through machine learning. Platform dynamically scales number of AWS
Spot/On-Demand instances that are used for processing. My improvements to
the project have resulted over $100k in savings each year and doubled number
of merchants that team can support.

It has system that constantly updates its data store with updates from other
systems and stores them in format that is optimized for reading from historical
prospective, also it exposes API that allows other systems to make queries to
retrieve different information for a URL(s) at the given time, enabling training
systems to train correctly their efficacy, as well as give the support team the
tools it needs to provide customer support, and enable efficacy engineering
team to write appropriate rules to achieve desired efficacy.

Contributor, open-source software.
I became a fan of open-source software the moment I consciously used it for the frst time back in
2009, developing a small project in Qt. At that time, I had already been using Linux for over two
years, but most of my projects were written from scratch, meaning that I didn’t use any thirdparty
libraries.
It was September 29, 2009, when the frst project I published to the open-source was born. Since
then I have open-sourced over 30 projects and contributed to over 100, including Linux kernel,
Android for x86, Docker, and Django.
I am an active maintainer of some packages on Docker Hub and conda-forge (Anaconda Python
repository).

Implemented automation scripts for customer-facing and internal applications of UpToDate, an
evidence-based medical clinical decision support resource at the point of care. Initial development efforts
were done in a Java-Selenium framework. For each test scenario I went through a Java design phase where
logically separated the business entity objects from the actual testing code and was able to implement the test
in an Object Oriented fashion. In the code interacted with a SQL object repository database where all element
values were stored. For Angular pages we used Protractor to better handle the automation efforts. Interacted
with an off-shore development team to implement their specific flavor of Protractor.
Participated in daily scrum meetings as part of Agile development methodology. Automation development
efforts were part of 2 week sprints after which test executions were migrated to nightly Jenkins runs in a
JSON file. After each development sprint participated in Technology-wide meetings where presented my
development efforts to a wider audience. Tools used as part of development efforts were Git/Bitbucket for
source-code management, Rally for User Story management and confluence for content collaboration.

Was responsible for writing automation for the GUI layer of the application. Initially used Java/Selenium
model and later a Java/Groovy framework. The maturity of frame work allowed us to randomize the
data-input part of the automation and increased the coverage beyond manual testing capabilities. All
automation was scheduled and ran through Jenkins tool. This allowed us to find bugs in the application much
faster than QA. All the tests were run in a selenium grid that supported multiple browsers and a reporting and
logging mechanism. One of daily tasks was to monitor these logs and in case of error find out if it was an
environment issue or there was a bug in the application. In addition automated most of Release Engineering
tasks through Jenkins. This included writing Ruby scripts to interact with Perforce server that managed daily
integration of concurrent release branches, updates from production patches and other activities. Also daily
building and deployment of the application to different stacks were automated through Jenkins which needed
to be monitored daily. Wrote programs that extended java syntax-checking (check-style) capabilities that
tailored it for our own code base. These programs were run daily as part of the build process and reported
duplicate import statements and other warnings/errors. Another Release Engineering task was to run daily
Shell scripts with embedded SQL queries that updated databases with all the table-columns and other related
information as releases progressed. Eventually was automated through Jenkins and monitored daily for errors
that were reported to individual developers who had authored the script. Familiarity with Java/Jsp code
allowed me to fix build compilation errors temporarily so the application would build, prior to having the
developers fix the code.",,48/2016 Automation & Release Engineer,,36405439.pdf

invalid delivered service result. Responsibilities included design verification using UML, testing object
interaction and relationship implemented by associations and aggregation, writing java code to test the data
and interacting with oracle database to insure the integrity of the saved data. Other responsibilities include
